# 2D-Simulator-for-Robot-Example
This repo contains code for generating images of the simulation and a collection of videos from previous simulation runs.


Copy the simulator.py file into a directory of your choosing, and include a folder called "images". When you run the program, it will generate (3000) images which can be converted into a video using external software (e.g., virtuadub).

You can change the parameters image_size, number_of_resources, number_of_workers, and total_generations.


Download and unizp the zip files to see the videos of previous simulation runs.
